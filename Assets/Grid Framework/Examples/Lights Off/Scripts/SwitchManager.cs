	ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
	
This script declares a delegate and defines an event. The event will be
fired when a switch is clicked and passes the grid as well as the
switch's coordinates in grid space. Other than that it has nothing to do
with grid Framework. The event is handled and fired in a seperate script.

	//as arguments the coordinates of the switch and which grid to use.
