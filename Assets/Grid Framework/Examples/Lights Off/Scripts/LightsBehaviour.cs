/*
	ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
	
This script performs two tasks. For one, if the object it is attached to
gets clicked it will fire off an event (defined in another script) which
will be handled by this script as well. When the event is received the
script compares the object's grid coordinates and the coordinates of the
object that was clicked to decide what to do next.
This example uses delegates and events. While it would have been possible
to do this in another way, delegates and events are the most elegant and
performant solution, since they are native to .NET

This script demonstrates how you can use grid coordinates for game logic
with tiles that seem to work together but don't actually know anything
about each other, giving you great freedom in designing your levels.
