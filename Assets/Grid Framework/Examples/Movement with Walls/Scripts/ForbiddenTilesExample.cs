	ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
	
This script is not a MonoBehaviour, it's a public static class that doesn't inherit from
anything. The class has three functions: it stores a two-dimensional array of bool values
(I will call this array matrix from now on and its entries squares), it sets and returns
the value of squares based on which world positions they correspond to.
	Each square represents a face of a rectangular grid on the XY plane and its position in
the matrix mirrors its position in the grid with (0,0) being the lower left face, the first
index denotes the row and the second index the column of a face in the grid.
	This class works together with two other scripts, SetupForbiddenFiles and BlockSquare.
The matrix is built first by SetupForbiddenFiles in the Awake() function to make sure it is
built before any Start() function gets called. It just calls the matrix-building method and
passes which grid to use fore reference. Then each obstacle fires the Start() function from
its BlockSquare script to set their tiles as forbidden. The player's movement script makes use
of the CheckSquare function to find out if a face is forbidden or not, but it doesn't write
anything to the matrix.

This script demonstrates how you can use Grid Framework to store information about individual
tiles apart from the objects they belong to in a format accessible to all objects in the scene.
	The information does not have to be limited to just boolean values, you can extend this
approach to store any other information you might have and build more complex game machanics
around it.

NOTE: the purpose of the "originSquare" variable might not be clear at first. In matrix coordinates
the lower left square has (0,0) and all the other square are relative to it. However, if your grid
does not start at the origin the matrix coordinates and the grid coordinates don't match, i.e. if
your grid starts in (-1,2) then a square that's 3 unitsto the right and one up has grid coordinates
(2,3) and matrix coordinates (3,1). In order to properly convert between matrix and grid we need to
be able to tell the square's position relative to the lower left square. if your grid starts at (0,0)
this would all be irrelevant
