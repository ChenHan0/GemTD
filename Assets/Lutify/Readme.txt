Thank you for buying Lutify, I hope it'll fit your needs !

To use Lutify without any external packages, simply add the component to your camera (Component -> Image Effects -> Lutify) and click the "Open LUT Gallery" to choose a LUT.

By default, Lutify comes with LUTs optimized for the default LUT effect bundled with Unity, Colorful FX, Scion and Amplify Color. You'll find them in the '/Lutify/Luts/' folder. You can quickly jump to a compatible LUT by right-clicking a LUT in the gallery.

Please note that for optimal results with the Retro LUT set support of point-filtering in the color grading shader is required. The one that comes with Lutify does support it but other solutions might not.
